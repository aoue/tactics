To create reinforcements, follow this process:

add the turn in the mission prefab 'event rounds' in the editor.

add a label to the mission ink file with the same turn as the entry in 'event rounds'

create the reinforcement arrays in the functions in the mission script. same turn number as before.

note:
if they're terribly important, then make sure to put them in some spot where there cannot be another unit on their tile
by the time they spawn. Because they cannot spawn if a unit is already on that tile.
