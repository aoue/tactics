Here's how you do an example choice stuff:

=== example_choices ===
lalala, back at the top of example choices.
* [Choice 1] -> label1
* [Choice 2] -> label2
* [Choice 3] -> label3
=== label1 ===
you clicked choice 1.
-> done_choices
=== label2 ===
you clicked choice 2.
-> done_choices
=== label3 ===
you clicked choice 3.
-> done_choices
=== done_choices ===
And now we are in done_choices, continuing as normal.
Let's end.

Huh? What are you even talking about, miss?

I'm not after a wall that'll repel power coming from outside. What I want is the kind of strength to be able to absorb that outside power, to stand up to it. The strength to quietly endure thingsâ€”unfairness, misfortune, sadness, mistakes, misunderstandings. 

~place("nvl")
There is something fundamentally important and distinctly human about taking a stance and engaging with the world on a deeper level than simple animal reward seeking behavior.
While the poet themself should be a respectable person, their poetry should not be constrained.
You've built it before, they've built it before. Hasn't really worked out yet, but neither has love. Should we stop building love?
Just because you've apologized, you think you have a right to be forgiven?

~place("nvl")
I hope this cleared nvl man!

... What does it even matter.
