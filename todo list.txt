=============================================== Next Real:

BUT fr fr, no more making assets until you've gotten a good distance into the script
...and won't be making any more changes! We HATE wasted assets!
(can work on game systems though)

we're going to have to redo all the art at a later point, so don't worry too much about it.

writing :)
	-can try our vn method again.

add to the everyone.kra file
	one a day
	-anse
	-rado
	-soeso and machine wolves (regular + rusted var.)
		the machine wolves should have their own name, kind of like how the mach penguins are called 'pigo'
		-wouloo (wolf, loup)
	-machine penguins (yeah it doesnt make sense for natural animals, but machines are fine)
		-pigo

event holder game object:
	-on hover, the whole image should darken. Right now, only the background does.
	Please improve this.

messenger from overworld:
	change this to be like a transmission receiver
	something sent from walkers to other walkers. Talking about weather, directions, news or other things
	-change the visual components so it looks like the message has been written down on a piece of telegram paper.

overworld ui frame:
	still doesn't look exactly how i want it too, but just wait. 
	-kind of like pyre's blackwagon interior

radio/messager:
	-change so that it fits theme better.
	-bg, text, everything; a complete overhaul

character art:
	-friday
	-anse
	-rado
	-soeso
	-machine wolf
	-rusted machine wolf

vn bg art:
	-snow dunes (reusable)
	-snow dunes with the walker in the background (reusable)
	-the walker, close up
	-the pagodo, close up
	-just outside the walker, in its shadow (reusable)
	-ruins (reusable)
	-inside the walker, pagoda

unit pre-turn picking:
	consider this feature:
	-the enemy will order all their unit picks at the start of the round.
	-if it comes to a unit's turn and they have been defeated or broken, then the enemy simply loses the turn

combat scene:
	fades:
	-implement for winning or losing the mission
	-implement for new events and reinforcements
	option to restart mission
	combat dialoguer:
	-add a visual cue so the player knows they can press 'f' for fast mode

vn portrait control:
	something to move a character portrait way down and leave it there
	~hide() //takes on and off commands. moves them down or move thems back 
	-kind of like the person is trying to hide. it would be funny and charming.
	fits friday in particular

=============================================== Art:

WAIT! Nothing more until the script is written!

character full/active portraits

enemy full/active portraits

unit map sprites

tile sprites

overworld bgs

vn scene bgs

trait icons

it sure would be nice to have active portraits of the units where they're holding their weapons

=============================================== Backlog:

objectives highlight:
	should show what the win and loss conditions are.
	should also show what the bonus objectives are. That's all.

combat scene help hover:
	(plan it out first)
	add a help hover area, under objective button
	-mouse over the help icon to show the help image.
	-it overlays on top of the entire ui and has arrows pointing at stuff and text explaining functions
	-hidden when mouse moves off the hover area

vn mode:
	-vn settings button:
		what should it have? things like:
		*text speed
		*auto wait time
		*skip entire event button

combat audio:
	framework is in place, but we need sounds for:
	-unit activation sounds (currently it's me making a noise lol)
	-footsteps sound; need a better sound, it's too quiet. It's played while unit is moving.
		-currently it's a short sound that is set on loop, but it really only plays once.
		-so probably getting a slightly longer sound and playing it once would be better.
	-trait sound effects. Every trait needs one.

flavour:
	since you can't draw weapons on the map sprites, change lore so that the characters don't carry weapons.
	instead they materialize the weapons with their programs and the weapon is there for a moment and does its thing
	-this would also involve changing active trait names to programs, i.e. variance_hammer()
	-and also changing passive traits ingame names to 'coroutines', or something
	i.e. actives are programs used explicitly, passives are coroutines which are always running
	-move anims, or weapon icons can help show that. like, map sprite not carrying wpn, but we can show it floating based on the move.

mission mechanics:
	-things like door controls, or destructible walls?

main menu bg:
	change every chapter to match current events
	-check against progress of most recent save

level tree design:
	UI overhaul:
	-add unit's px combat sprite in there somewhere
	-draw px border bgs, etc
	just in general, go over it and improve it.

minigames:
	(all good games have fishing minigames)
	-ice fishing, aim and throw a harpoon at moving fish; idk

options/settings menu: (we will need to be able to call it from main menu, overworld, and vn)
	-little gear settings button. clickable in overworld and vn scene. 
		-has sliders for volume (SE, music)
		-has slider for text speed
		-has slider for textbox opacity (one for centered, one for bottombox)
		-fullscreen, etc
