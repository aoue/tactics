simplify, simplify...

Notes for next commit message:
-fixed movement bug where enemies couldnt move through each other
-changed damage/heal display preview so it shoulds the result for every possible roll instead of the range
-

=============================================== Next Real:
Restrain yourself. Focus on writing, then art, then game systems. Everything follows from that order.
- it needs to have substance
- it needs to look good
- it needs to be fun
(in that order)

-combat bug:
	-sometimes enemies won't attack?!!?! wth

-combat design change:
	-think about this:
	instead of the rolls being small differences like 0.9, 1.0, 1.1
	they should be big differences, like:
	0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0
	so it's very obvious when a roll goes bad

vn scene mockup:
	-find examples
	get all the assets necessary to have a static frame in vn mode (can construct in just as an image)
	-bg image
	-characters
	-ui elements
	-font
	have this looking good in an example image file before implementing into the game

vn scene:
	since we have no namebox now and will be writing in prose:
	-probably need to move box portrait, change/resize font, new textbox bg

	portrait control:
	something to move a character portrait way down and leave it there
	~hide() //takes on and off commands. moves them down or move thems back 
	-kind of like the person is trying to hide. it would be a little bit funny and charming.
	fits friday in particular

	~flip() //character portrait effect
	-fade to low
	-flip
	-fade back

	breath effect:
	-puff of white air that appears near the character when outside
	-cool effect

combat scene assets:
	-tiles
	-unit sprites
	-ui frames
	previously this stuff was done with a pixel art style in mind.
	Since we're now moving away from that, a redraw seems in order.
	you can try drawing at a bigger resolution. We can just scale up the size of the tiles, no issue. Did it before.
	draw the tiles and unit sprites before resizing.

overworld backgrounds:
	two types:
	-close up of walker, we can see rooms, etc. click on rooms for events
	-aerial shot of the walker traveling some environment. click on places for events

enemy unit spawn:
	-level up unit
	-stat variation: every stat is randomly assigned to one value in the range 0.9*stat to 1.1*stat

overworld:
	add to main bg, a auto-scrolling panel across the bottom? 
	-that display location information, longitude and latitude, temperate, etc

game skeleton:
	-part 0 immediate
	-part 0 combat -> loads part 1
	-part 1 immediate

a text display sound? I think it could sound nice.
	-constant while text is displaying. 

combat scene power pool:
	

combat scene help hover:
	(plan it out first)
	add a help hover area, under objective button. Just a single image, overlayed overtop the combat scene.
	-mouse over the help icon to show the help image. Move mouse off to turn it off.
	-it overlays on top of the entire ui and has arrows pointing at stuff and text explaining functions
	-hidden when mouse moves off the hover area

event holder game object:
	-on hover, the whole image should darken. Right now, only the background does.
	Please fix this.

messenger from overworld:
	change this to be like a transmission receiver
	something sent from walkers to other walkers. Talking about weather, directions, news or other things
	-change the visual components so it looks like the message has been written down on a piece of telegram paper.

radio/messager:
	-change so that it fits theme better.
	-bg, text, everything; a complete overhaul

vn bg art:
	-snow dunes (reusable)
	-snow dunes with the walker in the background (reusable)
	-the walker, close up
	-the pagoda, close up
	-just outside the walker, in its shadow (reusable)
	-ruins (reusable)
	-inside the walker, pagoda

level tree:
	-on the right, instead of the active portrait, show a cg of the character lounging in the walker. 
	so cute. adds personality.

combat scene:
	power:
	-on plus/mius power, add a little animation to show this. Should be displayed on the unit/base that gives it.
	fades:
	-implement for winning or losing the mission
	-implement for new events and reinforcements
	option to restart mission
	combat dialoguer:
	-add a visual cue so the player knows they can press 'f' for fast mode



=============================================== Art:

WAIT! Nothing more until the script is written!

character full/active portraits

enemy full/active portraits

unit map sprites

tile sprites

overworld bgs

vn scene bgs

trait icons

it sure would be nice to have active portraits of the units where they're holding their weapons

=============================================== Backlog:

unit pre-turn picking:
	consider this feature:
	-the enemy will order all their unit picks at the start of the round.
	-if it comes to a unit's turn and they have been defeated or broken, then the enemy simply loses the turn
	well, don't add it now. Add it as a later, last touch kind of thing.

objectives highlight:
	should show what the win and loss conditions are.
	should also show what the bonus objectives are. That's all.

vn mode:
	-vn settings button:
		what should it have? things like:
		*text speed
		*auto wait time
		*skip entire event button

combat audio:
	framework is in place, but we need sounds for:
	-unit activation sounds (currently it's me making a noise lol)
	-footsteps sound; need a better sound, it's too quiet. It's played while unit is moving.
		-currently it's a short sound that is set on loop, but it really only plays once.
		-so probably getting a slightly longer sound and playing it once would be better.
	-trait sound effects. Every trait needs one.

flavour:
	since you can't draw weapons on the map sprites, change lore so that the characters don't carry weapons.
	instead they materialize the weapons with their programs and the weapon is there for a moment and does its thing
	-this would also involve changing active trait names to programs, i.e. variance_hammer()
	-and also changing passive traits ingame names to 'coroutines', or something
	i.e. actives are programs used explicitly, passives are coroutines which are always running
	-move anims, or weapon icons can help show that. like, map sprite not carrying wpn, but we can show it floating based on the move.

mission mechanics:
	-things like door controls, or destructible walls?

main menu bg:
	change every chapter to match current events
	-check against progress of most recent save

level tree design:
	UI overhaul:
	-add unit's px combat sprite in there somewhere
	-draw px border bgs, etc
	just in general, go over it and improve it.

minigames:
	(all good games have fishing minigames)
	-ice fishing, aim and throw a harpoon at moving fish; idk

options/settings menu: (we will need to be able to call it from main menu, overworld, and vn)
	-little gear settings button. clickable in overworld and vn scene. 
		-has sliders for volume (SE, music)
		-has slider for text speed
		-has slider for textbox opacity (one for centered, one for bottombox)
		-fullscreen, etc
