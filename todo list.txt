simplify, simplify...

Notes for next commit message:
-

=============================================== Next Real:
Restrain yourself. Focus on writing, then art, then game systems. Everything follows from that order.
- it needs to have substance
- it needs to look good
- it needs to be fun
(in that order)

-exp design:
	-all units gain a clear exp score every mission
	-speed clear bonus
	-base control bonus
	(defeating enemies should not give exp; collaborative! everyone has a role!)
	*if a unit was defeated, then it only gains a portion of clear exp
	-capturing artifacts (i.e. towns/chests) gives an item that can be used to give exp or raise stats back at the level tree
	*some artifacts unlock conversations/lore and affection points. So you need 'em for story i guess?

combat scene help hover:
	(plan it out first)
	add a help hover area, under objective button. Just a single image, overlayed overtop the combat scene.
	-mouse over the help icon to show the help image. Move mouse off to turn it off.
	-it overlays on top of the entire ui and has arrows pointing at stuff and text explaining functions
	-hidden when mouse moves off the hover area

level tree:
	-on the right, instead of the active portrait, show a cg of the character lounging in the walker. 
	so cute. adds personality.

combat scene:
	power:
	-on plus/mius power, add a little animation to show this. Should be displayed on the unit/base that gives it.
	fades:
	-implement for winning or losing the mission
	-implement for new events and reinforcements
	option to restart mission
	combat dialoguer:
	-add a visual cue so the player knows they can press 'f' for fast mode
	-combat audio:
		-stepping player: play a certain sound when a character is moving on the map. find/make sound and set up.

	
=============================================== Backlog:

unit pre-turn picking:
	consider this feature:
	-the enemy will order all their unit picks at the start of the round.
	-if it comes to a unit's turn and they have been defeated or broken, then the enemy simply loses the turn
	well, don't add it now. Add it as a later, last touch kind of thing.

objectives highlight:
	should show what the win and loss conditions are.
	should also show what the bonus objectives are. That's all.

vn mode:
	-vn settings button:
		what should it have? things like:
		*text speed
		*auto wait time
		*skip entire event button

combat audio:
	framework is in place, but we need sounds for:
	-unit activation sounds (currently it's me making a noise lol)
	-footsteps sound; need a better sound, it's too quiet. It's played while unit is moving.
		-currently it's a short sound that is set on loop, but it really only plays once.
		-so probably getting a slightly longer sound and playing it once would be better.
	-trait sound effects. Every trait needs one.

mission mechanics:
	-things like door controls, or destructible walls?

main menu bg:
	change every chapter to match current events
	-check against progress of most recent save

level tree design:
	UI overhaul:
	-add unit's px combat sprite in there somewhere
	-draw px border bgs, etc
	just in general, go over it and improve it.

minigames:
	(all good games have fishing minigames)
	-ice fishing, aim and throw a harpoon at moving fish; idk

options/settings menu: (we will need to be able to call it from main menu, overworld, and vn)
	-little gear settings button. clickable in overworld and vn scene. 
		-has sliders for volume (SE, music)
		-has slider for text speed
		-has slider for textbox opacity (one for centered, one for bottombox)
		-fullscreen, etc
